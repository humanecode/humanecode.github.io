  <h2>Rails Testing Workshop</h2>
  <p>Testing Rails applications can sometimes feel like a burden. Or worse, intimidating. But it doesn't have to be that way! Rails provides extensive tooling for testing your web applications, all out of the box. This workshop will show you how productive, easy, and <em>fun</em> tests in Rails applications can be. It will cover building a Rails application with tests using the tools provided by Rails 4.1. Topics covered include but are not limited to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Test Driven Development (TDD)</li>
    <li>Model tests</li>
    <li>Data fixtures and factories</li>
    <li>Mocks and stubs</li>
    <li>Controller tests</li>
    <li>Integration tests</li>
    <li>Acceptance tests using Capybara</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We will discuss the differences between classical TDD and outside-in BDD, managing dependencies within Rails applications, using tests to communicate intent to other developers, and adding test coverage to existing code. Attendees will be expected to be familiar with Rails and will need to bring a laptop computer with Ruby 2.0 installed.</p>

  <h3>Testimonials</h3>

  <section class="pure-u-1-3"><div class="l-box">
  <p>"The workshop is a great value. Anyone can lookup how to write the various types of assertions, but it takes more experience and insight to design an application that is easy to test. This workshop focuses on design that works with a hands-on approach that helps the lessons sink in. I recommend anyone that's learned how to write code and now wants to take charge of delivering professional-grade software to attend this workshop."<br>

  <p>"Mike's coding style and testing methods have changed the way I code for the better. I experienced several epiphanies over the two days. The explanation of bottom up development techniques was worth the price of admission for me. Well worth it."<br>

  <p>"Mike Moore is an accomplished developer with a great grasp of the tools and internals of the testing framework used by Ruby on Rails. The materials were presented in a way that it was easy for us to use it in our production code base the day after the workshop. We saw practical benefits on day one and continue to expand on that now."<br>
